# Code-First-Girls-Recipe-Search-
This is a group project completed for Code First Girls Kickstarter Python course. The aim of this project is to help users find recipes to cook base on certain parameters: meal type, cuisine type and ingredient. For this code, we are using a recipe API to retrieve recipes from a database.
